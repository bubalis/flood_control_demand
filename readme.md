This module provides the tools to perform a simple "flood control ecosystem-service demand" calculation for a region. 

The resulting raster map gives the relative contribution of different parts of a landscape to mitigating flooding from storm run-off. 



This method was developed by Keri Bryan Watson and is described in Watson, et al (2019), but has not been made available as a single module.


To execute this method you will need:

A digital elevation model of your area of interest.

A shapefile containing the point locations of structures in your area. This may be obtained from enhanced 911 (E911) databases.

A shapefile of your area containing soils data from the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO).
